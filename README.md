## Summary 

### Webpage Flaw

One drawback for the webpage that has been developed is the fact that it is structured around a static dataset. It would require manual updates to the dataset to ensure that it's capturing more recent events as well. 

### Recommendations

The webpage coull be improved by making one of the following edits:
* An additional filter field for the duration of the sighting
* Links could be added that direct to resources from the LAA mentioned in the website text
